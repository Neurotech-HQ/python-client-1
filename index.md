## Sending SMS with nextsms

Here is an example on how to send an SMS with this package;

```python

>> import nextsms
>> sender = nextsms('your username', 'your password')
>> sender.sendsms(message='hello', recipients=['25575XXXXX','25565XXXX'], sender_id="NEXTSMS")

```

## Bulky ?

NextSms allows you to predefine all message you would like to send with variety of sender IDs and does the rest on how to successful send to all.

Here an Example how you would do that with this package

```python

>> import nextsms
>> sender = nextsms('KalebuJordan', 'kalebu@opensource') 
>> messages = [
    {'from':'NEXTSMS', 'to':'255757294146', 'text':'hello'},
    {'from':'NEXTSMS', 'to':'255754205561', 'text':'hello'}]           
>> sender.send_bulk(messages)

```
